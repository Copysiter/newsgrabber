         'infrastructure and utilities, commissioner for Belt and Road '
         'Nicholas Ho told <i>The National</i>.</p><p>“We want Hong Kong to be '

         'We want to channel mainland Chinese investments [and] Asian '
         'investments into the Middle East at the same time as a mutual '

         'operates on the principle of “one country, two systems”, which makes '
         'the city a gateway for investment flows to and from China.</p><p>The '
         'city is ideally placed to be a launch pad for state funds, '
         'quasi-sovereign investment vehicles and private investors in the '
         'Arab world seeking investment opportunities in China and '
         'Asean.</p><p>“You need someone with a good standard, good branding, '
         'someone that has the international connectivity, the capital '
         'connectivity, the legal system, the common law … you need everything '
         'to make this a success and Hong Kong has it all,” Mr Ho '
         'said.</p><p>Several GCC sovereign investors, including the UAE’s '
         'Mubadala Investment Company, which invests on behalf of the Abu '
         'Dhabi government, and the Riyadh-based Public Investment Fund have '
         'opened offices in China.</p><h3><b>Push for deals</b></h3><p>In '
         'August, the PIF signed agreements worth up to $50 billion with six '
         'major Chinese financial institutions: the Agricultural Bank of '
         'China, the Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, the China '
         'Export and Credit Insurance Corporation, the Export-Import Bank of '
         'China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.</p><p>The '
         'pacts cover areas such as two-way capital flows through debt and '
         "equity, and enable Saudi Arabia to tap into China's banking sector, "
         'whose assets grew by almost 10 per cent last year, reaching 417.3 '
         'trillion yuan ($57.6 trillion), according to BBVA '
         'Research.</p><p>About $2.3 billion of sovereign capital from the '
         'Middle East flowed into the greater Chinese market last year, '
         'external executive director of Hong Kong’s central bank, Kenneth '
         'Hui, said at a conference in July.</p><p>In the UAE, the Abu Dhabi '
         'Investment Office last year partnered with Hong Kong-based Arte '
         'Capital to help Chinese companies expand in the Middle '
         'East.</p><p>Dubai is also working to boost the flow of Chinese '
         'investment in sectors such as logistics, clean energy technologies, '
         'electric vehicle manufacturing and artificial '
         'intelligence.</p><p>Companies based in the Gulf are also looking to '
         'secure deals in China. This year, Saudi Basic Industries '
         "Corporation, the Middle East's largest petrochemicals company, "
         'finalised a 44.8 billion yuan ($6.4 billion) investment in a Chinese '
         'joint venture.</p><p>In May, Alat, a subsidiary of the PIF, '
         'announced that it would invest $2 billion in Chinese tech company '
         'Lenovo’s convertible bond in exchange for the company opening a '
         'manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Saudi Aramco, the world’s '
         'biggest oil exporting company, is considering taking a 10 per cent '

         'China’s Belt and Road Initiative, the largest infrastructure, trade '
         'and investment programme embarked upon by a single '

         'investments in Arab economies, Mr Ho said.</p><h3><b>Cross '

         'largest markets in Asia.</p><p>The HKEX, considered a gateway for '
         'international investors to the mainland Chinese market, has actively '
         'sought to build relations this year with exchanges in the Gulf '
         'region, after a string of high-profile initial public offerings over '
         'the past few years.</p><p>In July, the HKEX announced that it had '
         'added the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange and the Dubai Financial '
         'Market as recognised stock exchanges. The move allows public joint '
         'stock companies listed on the two UAE exchanges to apply for '
         'secondary listings in Hong Kong.</p><p>In February, the HKEX also '
         "signed a pact with Saudi Arabia's Tadawul stock exchange, the "

         'big companies, whether they are sovereign or private, whether in '
         'energy or minerals or utility,” Mr Ho said. “These are the things '
         'that Hong Kong wants to attract in our IPO market, and we definitely '
         'want to attract family offices.”</p><p>At the end of last year, the '
