{'html': '<p><b>Live updates: Follow the latest on </b><b>Israel-Gaza '
         '</b></p><p>Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert, who led the '
         'country during the 2006 Lebanon war, told <i>The National</i> that '
         'Israel must seek to resolve the current conflict with Hezbollah '
         'through a "diplomatic agreement" that best serves the interests of '
         'its people.</p><p>However, he stated that efforts for a peaceful '
         'resolution to the conflict that has escalated in recent weeks are '
         'being blocked by the current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who '
         'wants to “present a picture of victory” to restore his reputation '
         'following the October 7 attacks.</p><p>Mr Olmert, who ordered the '
         'invasion of Lebanon in 2006, argued that the current Israeli leader '
         '“badly wants the war against Iran”, and that a retaliation attack '
         'for last week’s missile barrage is expected soon. He also suggested '
         'that Mr Netanyahu would probably want Donald Trump to win the US '
         'presidential election next month, and that by possibly bombing '
         'Iran’s oil installations, he would force up global oil prices, '
         'harming the US economy and enhancing the former president’s '
         'electoral prospects.</p><p>The Israeli politician, who is the last '
         'prime minister to discuss a two-state deal with Palestine, '
         'maintained that once the current wars ends, Israel will have to make '
         'a choice either to “fight for ever” or reach an agreement. “We have '
         'to decide, what do we want? To occupy them for ever and to fight '
         'with them for ever?”</p><h3><b>Lebanon diplomacy</b></h3><p>Israel, '
         'Mr Olmert argues, had a right to defend itself after Hezbollah '
         'started firing rockets into northern Israel on October 8 in support '
         'of its ally Hamas in Gaza. But after the deaths of more than 2,000 '
         'civilians in Lebanon, it has become a matter of finding the best way '
         'to resolve the conflict.</p><p>“If there is a way that we can '
         'conclude this confrontation in the north, now by an agreement, a '
         "diplomatic agreement, it's better,” he stated.</p><p>Mr Olmert was "
         "Israel's prime minister from 2006 to 2009. He negotiated a peace "
         'deal with Lebanon following the stalemate of the month-long war '
         'against Hezbollah in 2006. It resulted in UN Resolution 1701, which '
         'ended the fighting and brought in the UN Interim Force in Lebanon '
         '(Unifil), which patrolled south of the Litani River, 30km from the '
         'border, and was supposed to keep Hezbollah out of the '
         'zone.</p><p>Despite both sides breaching the 1701 resolution in the '
         'current war, Mr Olmert insists that it is "not dead at all”. “It '
         'depends on whether it will be implemented,” he explained. “Part of '
         'the agreement has to be a resolution that will be forced not only<b> '
         '</b>on us, but on them too.”</p><p>Mr Olmert was replaced by Mr '
         'Netanyahu after being forced out of office over corruption charges, '
         'for which he served 16 months in jail. He says the current prime '
         "minister ignored Hezbollah's breaches of the 1701 "
         'resolution.</p><p>“When I departed, they found out after a while '
         'that they can get away [with the breaches] with Bibi [Mr Netanyahu]. '
         'That behind the rhetoric there is not much substance in terms of '
         'resilience.”</p><h3><b>Netanyahu wants war</b></h3><p>His disdain '
         'for the current leader, who himself is facing a court date on '
         'corruption allegations, is clear. He blames Mr Netanyahu for the '
         'security failures of October 7 and argues he is using the ensuing '
         'war to restore his popularity.</p><p>“Bibi badly wants the war '
         'against Iran ... to drag Israel to the point where the appearance of '
         'victory will be accepted by enough people for them to forget the '
         'security blunders and present a picture of victory”. Mr Netanyahu, '
         'he argued, “believes that he is destined, perhaps by divine '
         'providence, to save the Western world” from extremists stoked by '
         "Iran.</p><p>The US, Mr Olmert said, would come to Israel's aid if it "
         "found itself in a complicated situation, despite Washington's "
         'dissatisfaction with Mr Netanyahu for courting a war with Iran '
         'over.</p><p>While he agreed Israel needed to retaliate to “create an '
         'impact that will deter the Iranians” after the recent Iranian attack '
         'with ballistic missiles, it has to be carefully calibrated, '
         'suggesting targeting “power stations not oilfields”. This might '
         'avoid a severe counter-retaliation and make Iranian people ask the '
         'question, “why do we need to pay so much for these Palestinians?," '
         'he added.</p><p>Targeting oil sites would likely send prices soaring '
         '“in a way that can be very, very damaging to the American '
         'government”, suggesting that “maybe Bibi wants Trump to '
         'win”.</p><h3><b>Return Palestinian land</b></h3><p>As prime '
         'minister, Mr Olmert came close to striking a deal with Palestinian '
         'Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas under which a Palestinian state would '
         'have been created with Israel relinquishing parts of the occupied '
         'West Bank and Jerusalem shared as the capital. With more than 41,900 '
         'Palestinians killed in Israeli fire in Gaza, a large number of '
         'Israeli fatalities, and the war expanding, the prospect of '
         'implementing a two-state solution appears remote.</p><p>But the '
         '79-year-old politician considers it the only way to permanently stop '
         'the fighting. “When the war ends, Israelis will have to ask '
         "themselves, 'we have destroyed Hamas, we destroyed Hezbollah, now "
         "what? Do we continue as the occupiers?'”</p><p>There are some "
         'far-right extremists, people he labelled “messianic, crazy Jewish '
         'ayatollahs”, who want settlements returned to Gaza and expanded into '
         'Lebanon. But he said it was impossible to ignore the more than six '
         'million Palestinians, and therefore it was in Israel’s interests to '
         'find an agreement.</p><p>He explained that while he, like many Jews, '
         'believes the occupied West Bank to be historically Jewish from '
         'biblical times, it would be worth it to give the land up for '
         'peace.</p><p>“I offered it to Abu Mazen [Abbas] 17 years ago, it was '
         'heartbreaking,” he said, speaking at his office in Tel Aviv. “But I '
         'was ready to compromise on something that I wholeheartedly believe '
         'is mine. For the sake of the future I was ready to make a concession '
         'about the past.”</p><h3><b>World against Israel</b></h3><p>Just a '
         'few days into Israel’s devastating response to the October 7 '
         'attacks, Mr Olmert knew the whole world would be against Israel '
         'because “they will see the result of the Israeli air attacks”. Given '
         'the tens of thousands of civilian casualties, he argues that Israel '
         'could have stopped the war long ago and saved many '
         'lives.</p><p>Palestinians, as the “most dynamic and gifted among all '
         'the Arab nations”, will find a way to build their lives amicably in '
         'a separate state if peace is found, he stressed. “I have no doubt '
         'about that, if they are given the opportunity.”</p><p>He also '
         'praised the UAE for being “absolutely admirable” in its support for '
         "Palestinians. “I'm very impressed with the subtleness, the "
         'sophistication of the Emirates,” he stated. “They did most of the '
         'humanitarian supply to Gaza, financed and organised by them. They '
         'have manifested the greatest degree of humanitarian empathy to the '
         'suffering of the Palestinians, yet their embassy is open and they '
         'remain in contact with Israel.”</p>',
